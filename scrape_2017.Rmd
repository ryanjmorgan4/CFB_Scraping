First, let's read in the current csv files (up through the 2016 Season).

```{r}
Game_Logs <- read.csv(file="C:\\Users\\Ryan\\Desktop\\OldSchoolStuff\\Fall_2017\\Creative Component\\CC Writeup\\CSV_Files\\Scraped_Data\\Game_Logs.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)

Game_Results <- read.csv(file="C:\\Users\\Ryan\\Desktop\\OldSchoolStuff\\Fall_2017\\Creative Component\\CC Writeup\\CSV_Files\\Scraped_Data\\Game_Results.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)

Individual_Season_Results <- read.csv(file="C:\\Users\\Ryan\\Desktop\\OldSchoolStuff\\Fall_2017\\Creative Component\\CC Writeup\\CSV_Files\\Scraped_Data\\Individual_Season_Results.csv")


Season_Averages <- read.csv(file="C:\\Users\\Ryan\\Desktop\\OldSchoolStuff\\Fall_2017\\Creative Component\\CC Writeup\\CSV_Files\\Scraped_Data\\Season_Averages.csv")

Total_Team_History <- read.csv(file="C:\\Users\\Ryan\\Desktop\\OldSchoolStuff\\Fall_2017\\Creative Component\\CC Writeup\\CSV_Files\\Scraped_Data\\Total_Team_History.csv")
```


We now have everything as of 2016, so we now want to update it to be up through the 2017 Season.



Update Total Team History:

```{r, eval=F, echo=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
library(lubridate)

asNumber <- function(dataframe, columns){
  temp= dataframe
  i = 1
  for(i in columns){
    temp[,i] = as.numeric(paste(dataframe[,i]))
  }
return(temp)
}

```

```{r, eval=F, echo=F}
nameFormat <- function(originalNames){
ans <- tolower(originalNames)
ans <- gsub(" ","-",ans)
ans <- gsub("[()]*","",ans)
ans <- gsub("[&]","",ans)
ans <- gsub("--","-",ans)
ans <- gsub("'","",ans)

nameReplace <- data.frame(old= c("lsu","smu","ole-miss","pitt$","uab","ucf","usc",
                                 "utep","utsa"), 
                          new= c("louisiana-state","southern-methodist","mississippi",
                                 "pittsburgh","alabama-birmingham","central-florida", 
                                 "southern-california","texas-el-paso","texas-san-antonio"))

numReplace <- length(nameReplace$old)

for(i in 1:numReplace){
  ans<- gsub(nameReplace$old[i],nameReplace$new[i],ans)
}
return(ans)
}

```

```{r, eval=F, echo=F}
yearsActive <- function(team){
  data =read_school_history(team)$Year
  
  return(data)
}
```


```{r, eval=F}
team_history_totals <- function(){
  url = "http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/"
  nodes <- "td"
  ans <- read_html(url) %>% html_nodes(nodes) %>% html_text()
  ans <- as.data.frame(matrix(ans, ncol= 19, byrow =T))
  colnames(ans) = c("Team","First_Year","Last_Year","Num_Seasons","Games","Wins","Losses","Ties","Winning_Pct","Bowl_Games","Bowl_Wins","Bowl_Losses","Bowl_Ties","Bowl_Winning_Pct","SRS","SOS", "Years_Ranked_In_AP","Conference_Championships","Notes")
  ans$Team = nameFormat(ans$Team)
  ans = asNumber(ans, c(2:18))
  return(ans)
}

Total_Team_History_updated <- team_history_totals()




```



Update Individual Season Results

```{r, eval=F, echo=F}
read_school_history <- function(team){
  team <- nameFormat(team)
  
  url = paste("http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/",team,"/", sep="")
  
  
  nodesText <- paste("poptip,td,#",team,"_clone a",sep="")
  
  
  schoolHistory <- read_html(url) %>% html_nodes(nodesText) %>% html_text()
  
  schoolHistory <- as.data.frame(matrix(data=schoolHistory,ncol=14, byrow=T))
  
  colnames(schoolHistory) = c("Year","Conf","W","L","T","Pct","SRS","SOS","AP_Pre","AP_High","AP_Post","Coach(es)","Bowl","Notes")
  
  schoolHistory$Bowl_Result = gsub("[[:print:]]*[-]","",schoolHistory$Bowl)
  
  schoolHistory$Bowl_Result = gsub("W","Win",schoolHistory$Bowl_Result)
  
  schoolHistory$Bowl_Result = gsub("L","Loss",schoolHistory$Bowl_Result)
  
  schoolHistory$Bowl_Result = gsub("T","Tie",schoolHistory$Bowl_Result)
  
  schoolHistory$Bowl = gsub("[-][WLT]","",schoolHistory$Bowl)
  
  schoolHistory$Team = rep(team,length(schoolHistory[,1]))
  
  schoolHistory = asNumber(schoolHistory,c(1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11))
  
  
  schoolHistory <- schoolHistory[c(16, 1:9,11,10,12,13,15,14)]
  
  schoolHistory
}

```

We want to read in the "School History" pages for every team available. I wrote a mult_history function to use the read_school_history function on multiple schools.

```{r, eval=F, echo=F}
mult_history <- function(teams){
  numteams = length(teams)
  
  output = read_school_history(teams[1])
  
  i=2
  
  for(i in 2:numteams){
    output <- rbind(output, read_school_history(teams[i]))
    
  }
  
  output
  
}

```

I then ran the mult_history function on the TeamList list of 296 teams.

```{r, eval=F, echo=F}
TeamList <- Total_Team_History$Team

Individual_Season_Results_Updated <- mult_history(teams=TeamList)

```



Update Season Averages

```{r}
read_team_stats <- function(team,year){
  
  team <- nameFormat(team)
  
  url=paste("http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/",team,"/",year,".html",sep="")
  
  teamStats <- read_html(url) %>% html_nodes("#team td") %>% html_text()
  
  teamStats <- as.data.frame(matrix(teamStats,ncol=22, byrow = T))
  
  colnames(teamStats) =c("Games","Completions","Pass_Attempts","Completion_Percentage","Passing_Yards","Passing_TD","Rushing_Attempts","Rushing_Yards","Rushing_Avg","Rushing_TD","Plays","Total_Yards","Yards_Per_Play","Pass_First_Downs","Rush_First_Downs","Penalty_First_Downs","Total_First_Downs","Number_Of_Penalties","Penalty_Yards","Fumbles","Interceptions","Turnovers")
  
  
  
  teamStats <- asNumber(teamStats, c(1:22))
  
  teamStats$Season = rep(year,3)
  teamStats$Team = rep(team, 3)
  
  conf <- paste((read_school_history(team) %>% filter(Year==year)%>% select(Conf))[1,1])
  
  teamStats$Conference = rep(conf, 3)
  
  teamStats <- teamStats[c(24,23,25,1:22)]
  
  teamStats$Type = c("Offense","Defense","Difference")
  
  teamStats <- teamStats[c(1:3,26,4:25)]
  
  teamStats
}


read_team_stats(team="nebraska", year = 2017)
```

get a list of teams who played in 2017:

```{r}

teams_2017 <- Total_Team_History_updated %>% filter(Last_Year == 2017)

teams_2017 <- teams_2017$Team

teams_2017 <- nameFormat(teams_2017)
```


```{r}

    output <- bind_rows(output, read_team_stats(teams[i], 2017))

Update Game Logs

  #Get rid of the last row (the totals)
  
  numRows = length(rownames(gameLog))
  
  gameLog <- gameLog[-numRows,]
  
  
  #Fix the Date Column
  
  gameLog$Date = ymd(gameLog$Date)
  
  
  #Fix Location Column

  gameLog$Opponent = gsub("\\*","",gameLog$Opponent)
  
  
  # Fix the Result column. We want either a "Win" or "Loss" under the "Result Column." We will also want A column with "Team Points" and "Opponent Points"
  
  
  temp = gameLog$Result
  
  result = temp
  
  result=gsub("[[:digit:]]*","",result)
  
  result=gsub("[\\(\\)-]*","",result)
  
  result=gsub("\\s","",result)
  
  gameLog$Result=result

  #Make a "Season" column
  
  gameLog$Season = rep(season,length(gameLog$Date))
  
  
  #Put the columns in a logical order

  #Return
  
  return(gameLog)
  
}
```

```{r}
mult_team_offenseLogs_2017 <- function(teams){
    numteams = length(teams)
  
  output = OffensegameLogs(teams[1],2017)
  
  i=2
  
  for(i in 2:numteams){
    output <- bind_rows(output, OffensegameLogs(teams[i],2017))
    
  }
  
  output
  
}

offense_2017_logs <- mult_team_offenseLogs_2017(teams_2017)
```


Now the defense logs part:

```{r}
opponents_2017<-unique(offense_2017_logs$Opponent)

problemOpponents <- sort(opponents_2017[!opponents_2017 %in% teams_2017])

```
Some with "". Lets look at those:


```{r}
offense_2017_logs %>% filter(Opponent == "")

```

Three games with opponent of "":

fresno-state on 09-02 should be incarnate-word
old-dominion on 09-02 should be albany
texas-state on 09-02 should be houston-baptist

so fix these. 

```{r}

offense_2017_logs$Opponent[1040] = "albany"

offense_2017_logs$Opponent[419] = "incarnate-word"

offense_2017_logs$Opponent[1331] = "houston-baptist"


```

```{r}
opponents_2017<-unique(offense_2017_logs$Opponent)

problemOpponents <- sort(opponents_2017[!opponents_2017 %in% teams_2017])

problemGames <- offense_2017_logs %>% filter(Opponent %in% problemOpponents)

dim(problemGames)

```

so there are 109 bad games that I need to fix. Okay. Fine. 


```{r}
manually_Enter <- problemGames

manually_Enter$Team = problemGames$Opponent

manually_Enter$Opponent = problemGames$Team

manually_Enter$Points_Scored = problemGames$Opp_points

manually_Enter$Opp_points = problemGames$Points_Scored


## Flip Locations ##
temp= problemGames$Location

temp[problemGames$Location == "Home"] = "Away"

temp[problemGames$Location =="Away"] = "Home"

manually_Enter$Location = temp

## Flip Result ##

temp= problemGames$Result

temp[problemGames$Result=="W"] = "L"

temp[problemGames$Result =="L"] = "W"

manually_Enter$Result = temp


manually_Enter[,9:29] = NA
```


I will then write this file as a CSV where I will enter all those annoying offense logs for those teams...

```{r}
write.csv(manually_Enter,"manual_Games.csv")
```
read it back in:

```{r}

ManualGames <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\Ryan\\Desktop\\CFB_DATA\\manual_Games.csv")

ManualGames$Date = mdy(ManualGames$Date)

ManualGames$Team = nameFormat(ManualGames$Team)

ManualGames$Opponent = nameFormat(ManualGames$Opponent)

```

FIX THE CHARLOTTE THING. SOMETIMES CALLED UNC-CHARLOTTE. REMOVE THE CHARLOTTE GAMES FROM THE MANUAL GAMES.

```{r}
offense_2017_logs$Opponent = gsub(pattern = "unc-charlotte",replacement = "charlotte",x = offense_2017_logs$Opponent)
ManualGames$Team = gsub(pattern="unc-charlotte", replacement="charlotte", x=ManualGames$Team)
```


Now bind it up:
```{r}
offense_2017_logs <- bind_rows(offense_2017_logs, ManualGames)

offense_2017_logs <- unique(offense_2017_logs)
```


```{r}
read_defense_log <- function(team, year, offenselogs = offense_2017_logs){
  
  team = nameFormat(team)
  
  offenseStats <- offenselogs %>% filter(Team==team, Season==year)
  
  opponentList <- offenseStats$Opponent
  
  dateList <- offenseStats$Date
  
  numOpponents <- length(opponentList)
  
  defenseLog <- data.frame()
  
  i=1
  
  
  for(i in 1:numOpponents){
    newLog = offenselogs %>% filter(Team==opponentList[i],Date == dateList[i])
    
    defenseLog = bind_rows(defenseLog, newLog)
  }
  
  return(defenseLog)
   
}


All_Defense_Log <- function(teamList, offenseLogs= OffenseLogs){
  numTeams = length(teamList)
  
  i = 1
  
  defenseLogs = data.frame()
  
  for(i in 1:numTeams){
    new = read_defense_log(teamList[i],2017)
    
    defenseLogs = bind_rows(defenseLogs, new)
    
  }
  
  return(defenseLogs)
}

```

Now make the defense logs:

```{r}
defense_2017_logs <- All_Defense_Log(teams_2017)

```

Throw it all together into game logs:


```{r}
colnames(offense_2017_logs) = c("Team","Season","Date","Location","Opponent","Result","Points_Scored","Opponent_Points_Scored","Offensive_Pass_Completions","Offensive_Pass_Attempts","Offensive_Passing_Pct","Offensive_Pass_Yards","Offensvie_Pass_TDs","Offensive_Rush_Attempts","Offensive_Rush_Yards","Offensive_Rush_Avg","Offensive_Rush_TD","Offensive_Total_Plays","Offensive_Total_Yards","Offensive_Yards_Per_Play","Offensive_Pass_First_Downs","Offensive_Rush_First_Downs","Offensive_Penalty_First_Downs","Offensive_Total_First_Downs","Penalties_Committed","Penalty_Yards_Against", "Offensive_Fumbles","Offensive_Interceptions","Turnovers_Against")


colnames(defense_2017_logs) = c("Team","Season","Date","Location","Opponent","Result","Points_Scored","Opponent_Points_Scored","Defensive_Pass_Completions","Defensive_Pass_Attempts","Defensive_Passing_Pct","Defensive_Pass_Yards","Defensive_Pass_TDs","Defensive_Rush_Attempts","Deffensive_Rush_Yards","Defensive_Rush_Avg","Defensive_Rush_TD","Defensive_Total_Plays","Defensive_Total_Yards","Defensive_Yards_Per_Play","Defensive_Pass_First_Downs","Defensive_Rush_First_Downs","Defesnvie_Penalty_First_Downs","Defensive_Total_First_Downs","Penalties_For","Penalty_Yards_For","Defensive_Fumbles","Defensive_Interceptions","Turnovers_For")



defense_2017_logs = defense_2017_logs[c(1:3,5,9:29)]

temp = defense_2017_logs$Team

defense_2017_logs$Team= defense_2017_logs$Opponent

defense_2017_logs$Opponent = temp
```

```{r}
offense_2017_logs<- offense_2017_logs %>% filter(Team %in% teams_2017)
```

```{r}
gameLogs_2017 <- left_join(offense_2017_logs, defense_2017_logs)

```

Making sure each row is unique:

```{r}
dim(offense_2017_logs)

dim(unique(offense_2017_logs))

dim(defense_2017_logs)

dim(unique(defense_2017_logs))

OLog <- offense_2017_logs[,7:29]

DLog <- defense_2017_logs[,5:25]

dim(OLog)

dim(unique(OLog))

dim(DLog)

dim(unique(DLog))
    
```


Now clean up and organize the data frame by organizing by Team and then Date. 

```{r}
gameLogs_2017 <- gameLogs_2017 %>% arrange(Team, Date)

```



```{r}
anti_join(schedule_results_2017,gameLogs_2017)

```
```{r}

colnames(schedule_results_2017) <- c("Team","Season","Conf","Game_Number","Date","Day","Location","TeamRank","Opponent","OpponentRank","OpponentConf","Result","Points_Scored","Opponent_Points_Scored","CurrentWins","CurrentLosses","CurrentStreak","Notes")

schedule_results_2017$Date <- ymd(schedule_results_2017$Date)

gameLogs_2017 <- left_join(schedule_results_2017, gameLogs_2017)
```


Re-do the cleaning:


```{r}
colnames(Total_Team_History_updated)[c(2,3,4,5,10,17,15,16)] <- c("First_Season","Last_Season","Number_Of_Seasons","Games_Played","Bowl_Games_Played","Number_Of_Seasons_Ranked_In_AP_Final_Poll","Simple_Rating_System","Strength_Of_Schedule")

colnames(Total_Team_History_updated)


which(is.na.data.frame(Total_Team_History_updated),arr.ind=TRUE)
```

Most of those NA's are for the Bowl winning percentage. Change the NA's to 0's.

```{r}
Total_Team_History_updated[is.na.data.frame(Total_Team_History_updated)] <- 0

Total_Team_History_updated <- Total_Team_History_updated %>% arrange(Team)

write.csv(file = "Total_Team_History_2017.csv",Total_Team_History_updated, row.names = F)

```




```{r}
